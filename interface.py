    Args:
        window (int): The duration in milliseconds.
        formant_width (int): The width of the formant in cents. The percieved magnitude at the formant will be the same
        but the actual magnitude at fine points in the formant will be different. A formant width of 0 will result in a
        pure tone at the fundamental. A formant width of 100 should result in frequencies at the f plus and minus 1 and
        in between.
        fundamental (int): The fundamental frequency in Hz. Defaults to 440.
